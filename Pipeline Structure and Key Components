# Pipeline:
# Metaflow is used to orchestrate the entire training and deployment process.
# The pipeline includes steps for data processing, model training, and saving predictions, managed by Metaflow.

# Data Validation:
# Great Expectations validates input data to ensure quality, with checks for data type consistency, ranges, and missing values.

# User Interaction:
# A User class handles different question types and response preferences, customizing interactions based on user needs.

# Key Components:
# LSTM Model: An LSTM-based neural network is used for classifying questions.
# Weak Supervision: Questions are labeled through rule-based and similarity-based techniques for efficient data labeling.
# MLflow: Manages experiment tracking and model versioning to maintain model performance history.
# Metaflow: Orchestrates the full pipeline from data processing to deployment, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
# FastAPI & Streamlit: FastAPI serves as the backend for model predictions, while Streamlit provides a user-friendly frontend.
# Great Expectations: Ensures data quality through validation steps in the pipeline.

# Project Summary:
# This project implements a scalable and maintainable pipeline for question classification, integrating robust tools for
# data processing, model deployment, and user interaction.

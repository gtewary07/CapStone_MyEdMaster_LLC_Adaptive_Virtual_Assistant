The Adaptive Virtual Assistant project by MyEdMaster aims to develop a virtual assistant technology which personalizes responses based on each userâ€™s understanding and unique learning style. The main goal is to develop an evaluation method using an NLP and ML model which will help track the student's understanding of the concept.

To achieve this, MyEdMaster aims to build an evaluation method using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that continuously assess a student's understanding of the material. The system will track the user's responses, detecting areas of confusion or difficulty, and adjust its approach accordingly. This model will provide real-time feedback, helping students grasp concepts more effectively by aligning with their cognitive preferences. By combining NLP and ML, the Adaptive Virtual Assistant will foster a more personalized and impactful educational experience, ensuring that students receive targeted support based on their individual learning journey.
